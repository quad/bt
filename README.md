# build thing: distributed continuous integration

## Why?

* Because it should be easy to put a project under CI.
* Because it should be easy to configure **and** reconfigure.
* Because it should be easy to get logs and reproduce results.
* Because it should be easy to take advantage of more hardware.

We were unhappy with the state of the art and knew we could do better.

## Requirements

* Ruby 1.9 (compiled w/ LibYAML)
* Git 1.7.2+

### Anti-requirements

* *"Infrastructure"*

## Huh?

Read our [cookbook][1]! Or, ask us [questions][2]!

We're too nascent for a mailing list or an IRC channel.
