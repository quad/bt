# build thing: distributed continuous integration

## Why?

* Because it should be easy to put a project under CI.
* Because it should be easy to reconfigure.
* Because it should be easy to get or reproduce logs and results.
* Because it should be easy to take advantage of more hardware.

We were unhappy with the state of the art and knew we could do better.

## Requirements

* Ruby 1.9 (compiled w/ LibYAML)
* Git 1.7.2+

### Anti-requirements

* A boss
* *"Infrastructure"*
